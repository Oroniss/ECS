8/5/18 - Added standard constructors to all the component types.
8/5/18 - Started building the entity factory.

Remaining tasks.

Revise entity factory - Have the dictionary actually store the combinations of material + entity type, since we will
likely only need 1 or 2 different types at a time.

Just use csv files - later on write a parser to turn them into data base tables.
Add an abstract constructor which takes this as an argument.


Add an ECS serialiser.

Add unit tests for each piece.
